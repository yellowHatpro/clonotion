# Clonotion

Yet another **"oh I really wanna try this"** project.


## What is this project about
I generally don't make clones (ig?), but I really wanted to try and learn a couple of things before I can work on my main projects.
This project is like notion (is notion, maybe better?), and .. ig we all know notion

## Tech used
Yes, the most interesting part (It shouldn't be if you're a good dev)
- Next effin JS
- Supabase
- Drizzle ORM
- Will add more
